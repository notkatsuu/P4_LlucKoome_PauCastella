# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in Java. The BST is a fundamental data structure used in computer science for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Features

- **Generic Implementation**: Utilizes Java generics to create a versatile BST structure that can store any type of data.
  
- **Divide and Conquer Approach**: Methods are implemented using the Divide and Conquer technique, emphasizing recursive problem-solving.

- **Supports Recurring Traversal**: Extends the BST implementation to support recurring traversal in both ascending and descending order.

## Project Details

- **Language**: Java
- **Objective**: To create a robust BST implementation with efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal methods.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Projects will be evaluated based on efficiency, adherence to programming principles, and proper implementation of specified features.
