# Backtracking Algorythm

This project, completed as the final assignment for the Advanced Programming course at Tecnocampus, implements a backtracking algorithm in Java. The backtracking algorithm serves as the core solution approach for tackling combinatorial problems encountered throughout the course. Through this project, we explore the practical application of backtracking techniques in solving real-world computational challenges.
